## Projects

### 🧪 Detection & Defensive Security (Learning Project)
This project focuses on developing SOC-style thinking by analysing logs, identifying suspicious behaviour, and understanding how security events are investigated in practice.

**Focus areas:**
- Log review and analysis
- Understanding alerts and suspicious activity
- Structured investigation approaches

---

### 🤖 SOC Automation Concepts (Learning Project)
This project explores **SOC automation concepts** and how automation can support analysts by reducing repetitive tasks and improving consistency.

**Focus areas:**
- Understanding SOAR concepts
- Alert handling workflows
- Security process optimisation

---

## Why a Degree Apprenticeship
A degree apprenticeship allows me to **apply what I learn immediately**, develop professionally within an organisation, and build strong technical foundations while working towards a degree.
